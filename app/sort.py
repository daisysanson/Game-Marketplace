'''Using a quicksort to sort the ratings of each game from highest to lowest
obvsously, this could be done a much simpler way, but for the purpose of this algorithm assignment
I am demonstrating how this we can sort data in an array . A quickosrt divdes and conquers recursivly,
picks an index known as a pivot to split the array into smaller arrays containing higher and lower numbers from
below and above the value of pivot. The algortihm is medocare effecicy when measuered on BigO Notation
as it peforms O(n2) at worse case
